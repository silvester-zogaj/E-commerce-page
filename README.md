E-commerce page focused on the functionality of different little areas of the website such as the basket, the sidebar (mobile view), the quantity, images and the modal.

Quantity can be changed and, then you can add the amount to the basket. You can then view the basket and see the amount of the items added, or click the trash button to remove all items in your basket.

Modal can be opened by clicking an image and, then you can go through the images by either clicking directly on the image or clicking on the arrows.

Hamburger icon will show on mobile view, which can be used to open the sidebar.

In mobile view, once you add something to the basket, a message will pop up letting you know it has been added, and will remain on screen until you either close it or scroll up to the basket.
